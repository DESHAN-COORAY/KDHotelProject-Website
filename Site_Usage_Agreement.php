    <h5 class="col-lg-4 mt-4"><b>II. ELIGIBILITY</b></h5>
    
    The Site is available only to individuals and entities that can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, 
    the Site and the services offered by the Site are not available to minors. If you do not qualify, you may not use the Site. 
    You warrant that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older to reserve a room on this Site. If you are under the age of eighteen, 
    you may contact the hotel directly for assistance.<br><br>

    You also warrant that you are legally authorized to make the travel reservations and/or purchases for either yourself or for another person for 
    whom you are authorized to act. You may only use this Site to make legitimate reservations or purchases and shall not use this Site for any other purposes, 
    including without limitation, to make any speculative, false or fraudulent reservations, or any reservation in anticipation of demand.<br><br>

    We reserve the right to cancel or modify reservations where it appears that a customer has engaged in fraudulent or inappropriate activity or 
    under other circumstances where it appears that the reservations contain or resulted from a mistake or error, or from an attempt to circumvent 
    KDH Inc or hotel policies, terms or conditions.<br><br>

    You understand that overuse or abuse of the reservation facilities of this Site may result in your being denied access to such facilities.<br><br>

    Reservations made by one or more individuals or by an agency on the Site, on behalf of one or more proposed guests, and involving more than nine 
    (9) rooms at the same hotel for the same period of stay, must be made directly through the hotel. If more than nine (9) rooms at the same hotel for the 
    same period of stay are booked through any other method, we reserve the right to cancel or impose additional requirements on such reservations.<br><br>

    Some rates have special eligibility requirements such as KD Hotel Honors, AAA or AARP membership. It is your responsibility to verify that you qualify 
    for the rate that you have booked. Hotels are not obligated to honor rates if you do not qualify.

    Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than

    comments with respect to the same, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials (unless specifically requested by us).<br><br>

    If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions or, despite our request, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, 
    or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property. None of the Submissions shall be 
    subject to any obligation of confidence on our part and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing,

    or discuss illegal activities with the intent to commit them; (iv) post or distribute any material that infringes and/or violates any right of a third party 
    or any law; (v) post or distribute any vulgar, obscene, discourteous or indecent language or images; (vi) advertise or sell to, or solicit others;

    or theme of any chat room or bulletin board. You shall remain solely responsible for the content of your messages and shall indemnify and hold the Indemnified 
    Parties harmless for the content of such messages. We reserve the right to remove or edit content from any Forum at any time and for any reason.<br><br>

    By uploading materials to any Forum or submitting any materials to us, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such materials expressly granted) 
    us a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and display,

    affiliated with in any chat room, message board, or other user generated content area. Information obtained in a Forum may not be reliable, and it is not a 
    good idea to trade or make any investment decisions based solely or largely on information you cannot confirm. We cannot be responsible for the content or 
    accuracy of any information, and shall not be responsible for any trading or investment decisions made based on such information.
